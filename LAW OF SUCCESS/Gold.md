# Success comes only when you act on what you know and believe.

# What your mind can conceive and believe , you can achieve !

# Who said it could not be done ? and what great victories has he to his credit
# that qualify him to judge others accurately ?

# Wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever you may be following as an occupation, there is a room for you to make yourself more useful and in that manner more productive, by developing and using your "imagination".

# TIME is a master worker that heals the wounds of temporary defeat, and equalizes the inequalities and rights the wrongs of the world, There is nothing imposiible with time !
