Good Afternoon/Morning Sir/Madam,
	
	At first, I am thankful to you sir (or) madam for giving me the
	opportunity to introduce myself.
	
	This is NISHANT SANJAY KUMBHAR. I live in PUNE.
	
	Currently, I am Pursuing my Bachelore Degree in Computer Engineering from 
	D. Y. Patil. College From Akurdi,

	
	Now coming to my strengths I am a self-motivated person. I am eager to
	learn different things. I always use to keep calm and relaxed during any
	ups and downs of life by doing some meditation and exercise.

	My weakness is that I am an emotional person and I easily believe people
	and now I am trying to overcome my weakness.

	

	My short-term goal is to work in a reputed company as yours. And I wanted
	to learn my things, and by learning the things I will get the experience
	also from it.

	And my long-term goal is to archive a good position where I can build my
	career as well as an organization too. And the also goal is to achieve a
	higher position in a reputed company.


	And even though I am fresher, I assume that I will give my best and work.

	


Thank you.
